    title: " CHANGE AND CONTINUITY IN AGBOR DYNASTY SINCE 1800",
    abstract:
      "This study provides a concise overview of the Agbor dynasty since 1800, exploring significant historical events, political structures, cultural developmental changes that have shaped the dynasty's trajectory during this period. Agbor dynasty saw a significant impact with the arrival of colonialism. The imposition of indirect rule by the British resulted in the erosion of traditional power structures, with native authorities replacing local rulers. This system weakened the authority of the Agbor dynasty, disrupted traditional belief systems and practices, leading to a gradual erosion of cultural traditions and customs. Additionally, formal education introduced through missionary schools led to cultural shifts and changes in language usage. Thus, it presents a brief snapshot of the primary themes and highlights key factors that have influenced the Agbor dynasty's evolution.",

                  The people of Agbor are known to have cherished their own
                  identity and way of life as a kingdom with one faith, hope and
                  destiny, so that even when they came in contact with diverse
                  groups, they retained their unique culture inherited from
                  their ancestors. 1Agbor kingdom is the most populous city
                  amongst the Ika people. It is located in Ika South Local
                  Government Area of Delta state, in the South-south
                  geo-political zone of Nigeria. It is the biggest and the most
                  cosmopolitan city in the Ika nation. Geographically, the land
                  area of this people covers the present villages of Agbor, Oki,
                  Ewuru, Aliagwa, Alisor, Ihuiyase, Omumu, Ozanogogo, Oruru,
                  Owanta, Alisimie, Alihame, Emutu, Obi-Oblibe, Agbor-ntaand
                  Amahai. It is said that the main body of the Agbor Kingdom
                  occupies the highland between the Orogodo River and the
                  Ossiomo River. The urban offshoot of Orogodo is situated
                  mainly on the western part of another highland, the top of
                  which is now inhabited by the people of Agbor, up to Emuhu
                  town. However, the headquarters of Agbor is said to have been
                  moved several times from one community to another until the
                  last in 1935 to Ime-obi. The reasons for the movement of the
                  headquarters are said to be due to its nearness to the centre
                  of power which is the king’s palace and security reasons also
                  the location reduces the external threat from the old Bini
                  kingdom and other neighbours who frequently invaded Agbor it
                  is also possible that the security of the headquarters from
                  external invaders was an important consideration in the
                  constant relocations of the headquarters. The kingdom also
                  found outpost towns far away from the kingdom to protect
                  itself from foreign invasions.

                  The indigenes of Agbor town are Ika but it is said that the
                  historic origin of the Agbor kingdom has different angles in
                  other words, the people of Agbor do not trace their origin to
                  a single place. Agbor has largely remained an Igboid community
                  indicating an earlier Igbo footing but some writers trace the
                  origin of agbor to the reign of Oba Ewedo of Benin. According
                  to this perspective – the Oba had twin sons named Edo and
                  Ogugunagbon. Both were subjected to a kind of lucky dip in
                  other to pick a successor to Oba Ewedo. Ogugunagbon was
                  unlucky to choose the wrong box and had to leave Benin with a
                  throng of his supporters to a new location leading to his
                  founding of Agbor. However, Prince Adams Gbenoba in his book
                  “The History and Culture of Agbor (Agbon) Kingdom’’ agrees
                  with the Benin origin.

                  The focus of this project is the Agbor Dynasty with a
                  particular emphasis on changes and continuity .2Dynasty is
                  referred to as a sequence or an era, during which a family
                  reigned, as well as events, trends and artefacts of that
                  period. The evolution of the Dynasty and the Agbor kingship
                  system is as old as Agbor itself. Kings emerged as society
                  developed from one stage to another because human society is
                  not fixed but characterized by constant change.3Therefore, as
                  society developed or advanced, there was a need to come
                  together to form an association for security and commerce. The
                  dynasty operates a traditional kingship system headed by a
                  king known as Ezeor Dein. The office of the Dein, Eze of Agbor
                  is hereditary whereby power is transferred from the father to
                  the most senior male child (first sonor okpala) after the
                  demise of the king, who continues to reign. The Dein is the
                  supreme authority for the entire kingdom. Dein was the first
                  traditional ruler of Agbor. He reigned from 1270-1307 with his
                  headquarters at Agbor-nta. As stated earlier, the headquarters
                  of Agbor has been moved to different locations for a couple of
                  times. 4The Dein was the commander in chief of the Agbor
                  kingdom and his warriors feared no foe. Their exploits are
                  legendary and they maintained their territories with an iron
                  fist.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Opone opined that the traditional ruler under the Agbor
                  kingdom was at the head of a well-organized system of
                  government.⁷As a sole authority he was the legislative,
                  executive and judiciary. The traditional institution of each
                  dynasty during the pre-colonial era was very important since
                  law and order were maintained through a normative system that
                  was part of the general social structure though the system was
                  not sophisticated, the machinery of government was organized
                  well enough to manage affairs, resolve tension and
                  administered justice in the society.⁸ Also, there was the
                  existence of certain unwritten laws in the kingdom which
                  ensured the security of the institution. This implies that
                  traditional dynasties had a positive impact on the evolution
                  of political, economic and social institutions in which they
                  had dominant control.{" "}

                  From the earliest kingship in Agbor to its subsequent
                  succession, each dynasty has impacted qualitative and
                  quantitative development in different aspects of life such as
                  population, education, belief systems, infrastructure and
                  other areas but our focus is towards it evolution of its
                  kingship system. The king carries out combined legislative,
                  executive, judicial, religious, and military responsibilities
                  assisted by their Council of Elders from the village to the
                  state level.⁹ As noted by Isaac, these various institutions
                  were in no way similar to Western institutions in terms of
                  structure, administrative procedures, substance
                  responsibilities, privileges or attached, but carried similar
                  levels of social and political cohesion in their respective
                  communities as were found in Western countries at the time.¹⁰
                  The unity, peace and security of kingdoms, chieftains, and
                  communities were largely dependent on the good leadership and
                  protection of their kings, chiefs, sub-chiefs and
                  community/family leaders that constituted the hierarchy of the
                  chieftaincy institution.¹¹ In light of Ejiofor, he opined
                  that"traditional governance evolved around the kingship and
                  chieftaincy institution and the associated conflicts were
                  resolved through customary arbitration by the king aided by
                  his elders constituted as customary arbitrators."¹²

                  Ijeoma referred to decentralized states in pre-colonial
                  Nigeria as settlements or groups of settlements without power,
                  royal dynasties or highly centralized governments, lacking
                  urban capitals, and much smaller both in territory and
                  population.¹³ These descriptions represented a clan, village
                  group, and segmentary town or land. Agbor Dynasty evolved its
                  political system and structure through changes and dynamics
                  from the family unit to a village/clan and went on to central
                  authority. It is pertinent to note that certain pre-colonial
                  societies only evolved to the village or clan level, while
                  others took on a fully centralized political structure.¹⁴ In a
                  bid to understand this political structure formation process
                  in the Agbor Dynasty, a historical analysis of the evolution
                  process has been examined by Edo. He argued that the family
                  unit became an extended family that metamorphosed into a
                  lineage. The advent of a lineage led to migration, settlement
                  and leadership. The conglomeration of family and extended
                  family units necessitated the emergence of a village. At the
                  village level, there were unarguably two factors that bound
                  the people, blood ties and language. Also, the village
                  settlement facilitated the emergence of a cosmopolitan or
                  complex society called the clan. The political institution
                  (leadership) that emerged at this level was based on language
                  and blood ties. The expansion of the village through economic
                  growth and military conquest led to the initialization of
                  central political authority. At this level, leadership is
                  regarded as both political and religious.¹⁵ Hence, the
                  evolution of political institutions in the Agbor kingdom is
                  based on the founding of collective interest and objective.

                <p>
                  Ade has argued that the centrality of kingship in every
                  society has given unprecedented popularity to the concept of
                  democracy. It is the way that society is governed that
                  determines whether it is democratic or authoritarian. Such a
                  system of governance equally has implications for the values
                  and norms by which the society lives by. It is the structure
                  of a society that determines to a large extent the type of
                  kingship that can emerge from it.¹⁶ In light of the above, the
                  Agbor kingdom or Dynasty evolved because the structure of a
                  society has inherent peculiar challenges which correspondingly
                  demand peculiar solutions.

                  During the British colonial rule in Nigeria, the British
                  sought an easy way to rule the country without spending a lot
                  of money. They decided to select some individuals and made
                  them oversee the affairs of the people at the grassroots to
                  meet their desire, recognizing the kingship system available
                  in both the northern and western parts of the country.¹⁷ This
                  system thus forestalls the existing protocol of traditional
                  authority in the Agbor Kingdom, and utilized chiefs, the
                  kingdom was chipped into small communities for effective
                  administration by the colonial masters hence limiting the
                  jurisdiction of the king. Indirect Rule was implemented in the
                  Igbo areas, from which the Agbor kingdom was not exempted.
                  Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the traditional system
                  and its republican nature, the Warrant Chief system did not
                  work well which resulted in social dislocation.¹⁸ The
                  subsequent abolition of the warrant chief system by the
                  colonial government, falling back to the direct system.
                  Traditional administrations in the Agbor kingdom still looked
                  with nostalgia at the kingship system and sought to
                  reintroduce the system, though under different guises. This
                  study is aimed at reviewing the evolution of the kingship
                  system through the various Agbor dynasties.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold">Statement of the Problem</p>
                <p>
                  Dynasty history has not been as popular as other areas of
                  history, namely, political, social and economic. This is
                  largely the case with the Agbor dynasty, the focus of this
                  study. Thus, in popular literature, the study of the Agbor
                  dynasty had been obscured by the prominence given to the study
                  of other aspects of history concerning Agbor. Again, in
                  political or economic history, periodization is less difficult
                  because of landmarks but in Dynasty history, the position is
                  generally different. One cannot be certain of the relationship
                  in time perspective between one historical event and another.
                  This, therefore, raises the problem of chronology. There are
                  two main types of chronology. the relative and the absolute.
                  Relative chronology tries to give a sequence of events without
                  a definite timescale. The absolute chronology gives the
                  sequence of events within a time limit. In Dynasty,
                  reconstruction of the Agbor dynasty, most of the informants
                  interviewed relied on relative chronology in relating events
                  which had been traditionally transmitted to them. African
                  historians of preliterate communities such as Agbor of the
                  time understudy, had often to be content with relative
                  chronology" which often floated in a limbo between the
                  centuries.¹⁹There isn’t any substantial amount of work done on
                  the Dynasties of the Agbor kingdom, it almost often than not
                  seems like this part has been neglected by historians who
                  mostly focus on traditional institutions. Thus, the work,
                  therefore, will address important aspects of the Agbor Dynasty
                  that have not been investigated by historians. The task of
                  this research work is to examine in detail the ruling kings in
                  the Agbor kingdom, how did the colonial rule forestall the
                  existing dynasty? what are the effects of colonialism on the
                  reigning dynasty?
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold">Aims and Objectives</p>
                <p>
                  This study is an attempt to examine the History of the Agbor
                  dynasty. So much has been known about political history and
                  economic history but other areas have been neglected. The
                  Agbor dynasty is an important institution in Agbor This study
                  attempts to show that there is continuity and change in the
                  nature, work and place of the dynasty in Agbor kingdom and
                  history too. The continued recognition of the institution is
                  an effective way of making Agbor people take pride in their
                  traditions and preserving those worthy aspects of their
                  inheritance that make the people unique. For example, there is
                  the risk that with time, the old generation may completely
                  disappear with their valuable traditions and customs. Hence,
                  he urgently needs to preserve them in a more permanent form.{" "}
                  <br />
                  The objective has been to focus on the Agbor and its dynasty
                  in assessing the kingship institutions without paying due
                  attention to any other aspects. The Agbor dynasties, over the
                  centuries, helped to give the Agbor political system
                  resilience and stability. This study, therefore, hopes to fill
                  this gap. In addition, the Delta State, societies are not
                  identical in all details of their social organizations. Their
                  many groups represent sub-cultural variations, and it is only
                  to be expected that each group has a somewhat peculiar
                  kingship system. The need for area studies, therefore, arises,
                  if a clear picture of the Agbor dynasty is to emerge hence the
                  need for this study. This work, therefore. will stimulate
                  other research not only in Agbor but also in other areas of
                  Nigeria. The result of this research would no doubt be of
                  interest to historians. political scientists, anthropologists
                  and politicians alike. <br /> The main focus of this work is
                  to articulate the history of ruling kings from inception to
                  this present day, to deduce the notable changes that have
                  occurred due to the interference of the colonial masters, To
                  validate the current kingship if its practices are traditional
                  or have in some ways be influenced by western cultures.

                <p className="font-bold">Aims and Objectives</p>
                <p>
                  This is a relevant study in our contemporary times because it
                  will cover the whole of the Agbor Dynasty and will critically
                  examine the emergence and development of Agbor kingship
                  Institutions. <br />
                  The study will help to unfold the huge development that has
                  taken place in Agbor kingship from the time of its emergence
                  to the independent Nigeria period (recent time). The study
                  will also take a deeper view of the changing roles of the
                  Agbor dynasty and some of the challenges of the dynasty in
                  recent times; especially the crisis that affected it is
                  kingdom during the birth of the recent king. It is therefore
                  hoped that this research work produced for academic purposes
                  will go the extra mile to educate and enlighten indigenes of
                  Agbor who were born and bred elsewhere to know the history,
                  culture, traditional values and other relevant information
                  concerning the dynasty of Agbor. The findings will also
                  provide useful background information for future research in
                  the contribution of history towards the nation’s building and
                  preserving the culture and historical development of the Agbor
                  dynasty. <br /> This study will contribute immensely to the
                  academic development of history as a discipline. It will also
                  inform and educate the public and future researchers about the
                  Dynasty of kings in the Agbor kingdom. Our cultural heritage
                  also entails ground knowledge of our cultural past. Hence this
                  work will dig into the past that would in turn bring to light
                  relevant pieces of knowledge of Agbor’s historic past and
                  culture. Furthermore, the study will also break new grounds by
                  addressing important aspects of Agbor history that have not
                  been researched by historians.

                <p className="font-bold">Review of Related Literature</p>
                <p>
                  There have been ongoing discussions on the Igbo pre–colonial
                  socio-political system. The root of this discussion is the
                  existence of kingship institutions among the otherwise
                  predominantly segmentary Igbo groups. The research was carried
                  out by some Colonial British writers. <br />A study by Thomas
                  (1914) acknowledges the existence of kingship amongst the Igbo
                  west of the Niger (Agbor kingdom), but posits that these
                  kingship institutions were derived from Benin as a result of
                  wars, conquest and domination. “petty monarchies, chiefdoms or
                  chieftaincies” with petty rulers or chiefs have been the term
                  used to refer the west Niger Igbo kingdoms.²⁰This claim can be
                  debunked by what Chief A.E Iduweopined. According to chief A.E
                  Iduwe; <br /> our ancestors had long established an autonomous
                  kingdom based on Eze title before our contact with Benin."{" "}
                  <br />
                  Egharevba 1968, describes these so-called chieftaincies as
                  tributary to Benin and also claims that their beginning is
                  traceable to Benin. Egharevba did not notice that the lingual
                  terms in Agbor kingship are in no way similar to that of Benin
                  as the case is with the Yoruba kingship system. It is
                  instructive that “the Ancient saying of Igbo Enwe-Eze (Igbo
                  have no kings) continues to fascinate historians and
                  non-historians alike."²¹ for instance, a study by Dike (1982)
                  argues with considerable force that Igbo Enwe Eze – Igbo have
                  no kings. With particular reference to the Igbo west of the
                  Niger, he posits that kingship was disrupted in the area given
                  that Igboenweeze (Igbo have no king), concluding that the
                  institution was likely to have derived from Benin. Dike (1982)
                  tries to establish a relative distinction between the Western
                  and eastern Igbo political institutional systems, pointing out
                  that the former has a more centralized political institutional
                  system than the latter, saying that the institution was
                  introduced and cultivated by outsider elements in the
                  pre-colonial times.²² Disputing this fact is that Kingship in
                  Agbor evolved from a communal level. Change and dynamics
                  resulting from different factors constituted the necessity for
                  the development of kingship and were not somewhat influenced.
                  Ijoma (1983): reveals the existence of kingship as part of the
                  socio-political institutional organization of the western Igbo
                  area.²³ However, the study is sceptical about the indigenous
                  development of kingship and titles found among the western
                  Igbo communities.According Onwumechili (2000) supports this
                  position, namely, that kingship is intrusive in the general
                  Igbo area.²⁴ <br /> This category of historiography was reused
                  without significance, so often without refutation that it came
                  to be regarded as authentic. As a result, little or no attempt
                  was made to critically investigate its validity. A notable
                  piece of evidence is that no researcher took the extra mile to
                  question whether the institutions’ nomenclature or substance
                  originated from Benin or evolved indigenously among the Igbo.
                  According to Ifemesia, the Agbor kingdom’s indigenous system
                  of government is an interesting mix of village democracy,
                  monarchy and aristocracy.²⁵The democratic element in the
                  arrangement is vividly showcased in the village assembly, a
                  pooling of all the male members of the community; young and
                  old where issues of serious importance are discussed and
                  decisions are reached based on popular consensus.
                  Harneit-Sievers Agrees with the highlight above that the
                  monarchical element is reflected in the head chiefs or obi;
                  and the aristocratic element, in the bevvy of titled chiefs
                  subordinate to the chiefs or obi, is also known as Eze.²⁶ Each
                  of these three divisions in the traditional social structure
                  is charged with clearly defined powers, duties and
                  responsibilities which may not be abandoned, delegated or
                  shared as further stated by (Gwan 1964).²⁷ Further
                  demonstration of the fullness of democratic practice was what
                  might be termed the non-professionalisation of politics and
                  administration. The people were most involved in participation
                  in policy and decision-making processes. Sometimes, this
                  involved the threat of or actual imposition of fines for
                  non-participation. Ejiofor has argued that ‘The traditional
                  Igbo systems may be divided into two major types, namely, the
                  democratic and monarchical.’ He continued: ‘West of the Niger,
                  village kingdoms are the rule rather than the exception in the
                  communities.’ Furthermore, he observed that even the
                  democratic model did not have chiefs, but ‘they were at best
                  symbolic heads of village groups and their primacy was
                  honorific rather than jurisdictional.’²⁸ The Agbor Dynasty
                  maintained a democratic and to a substantial extent
                  centralised monarch society. Agbor Dynasty was democratic and
                  egalitarian to some significant extent. Thus while Direct Rule
                  was applied to the North (given that it already had a
                  centralized system of government and taxation), Indirect Rule
                  was applied to the South.²⁹ This alteration of the traditional
                  system of government by the colonial masters marked the
                  prelude to the introduction of alien systems of government
                  into Nigeria.{" "}

                <p className="font-bold">Scope of the Study</p>
                <p>
                  This study is limited to a specific area of Delta State. Agbor
                  to be precised.However, a watertight delimitation is not being
                  proposed. The time frame of the study is from 1800. The period
                  1800 is remarkable because there was evidence of the pattern
                  of political administration due to the overwhelming influence
                  of the colonial masters. Indeed, 1800 marked the general
                  ascendancy and visibility of the changes in the Agbor kingdom.
                  The scope of this study was strictly based on the changes and
                  Continuity Agbor Dynasty, though a brief expository study will
                  look into the past to complement any notable changes in the
                  Agbor Dynasty.

                <p className="font-bold">Research Methodology</p>
                <p>
                  Research Methodology is the specific procedures or techniques
                  used to identify, select, process, and analyze information
                  about a topic. In a research paper, the methodology section
                  allows the reader to critically evaluate a study's overall
                  validity and reliability. Thus, this research work will make
                  use of both primary (oral evidence and archival) and secondary
                  (written) sources, and employ historical methods of
                  description and analysis to bring to light the basic
                  foundation of the Agbor Dynasty and detect the change within
                  the scope of the research.

                <p className="font-bold">Limitations of the Study</p>
                <p>
                  As in every human activity, the researchers encountered slight
                  constraints while carrying out the study. The significant
                  constraint was the scanty literature on the subject owing to
                  the nature of the discourse as concerned with the Agbor
                  dynasty. Given the fact that the availability of insufficient
                  material existed, most of the material thus where traditional
                  Agbor. In that most authors focused on the Agbor kingdom and
                  not its dynasty or their relationship with the Benin kingdom.
                  Thus, this post is a serious limitation to this research. the
                  researcher incurred more financial expenses travelling
                  frequently to Agbor Kingdom and much time was required in
                  sourcing the relevant materials, literature, or information
                  and in the process of data collection, which is why the
                  researcher resorted to a limited choice of sample size.
                  Additionally, the researcher will simultaneously engage in
                  this study with other academic work, coupled with a short time
                  to carry out the research work. More so, the choice of
                  participant interviews was limited as few respondents were
                  selected who were deemed fit to answer the research questions.
                  The delay in giving out the information by the Igwe secretary
                  constituted a problem for this research. As a royal person,
                  Igwe himself exhibited the “come today, come tomorrow”
                  syndrome. This made the research work take longer than it was
                  supposed to.
                  <br /> These limitations notwithstanding, the information
                  gathered for this study and research findings will be of
                  valuable assistance to the completion of the research.
